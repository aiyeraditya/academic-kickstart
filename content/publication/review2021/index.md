abstract_long = "Recent studies have served to emphasize the unique placement of amphibians, composed of more than 8000 species, in the evolution of the brain. We provide an overview of the three amphibian orders and their respective ecologies, behaviors, and brain anatomy. Studies have probed the origins of independently evolved parental care strategies in frogs and the biophysical principles driving species-specific differences in courtship vocalization patterns. Amphibians are also important models for studying the central control of movement, especially in the context of the vertebrate origin of limb-based locomotion. By highlighting the versatility of amphibians, we hope to see a further adoption of anurans, urodeles, and gymnophionans as model systems for the evolution and neural basis of behavior across vertebrates."
