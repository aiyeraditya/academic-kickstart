I am a third year graduate student at the Max Planck Institute for the Neurobiology of behaviour - caesar, working with Dr. Kevin Briggman. My project involves elucidating the development of neural circuits for locomotion during metamorphosis, in the tadpole _Xenopus tropicalis_.

My interests lie in understanding the neural bases of behaviour, and building tools to make studying behaviour a bit easier.
