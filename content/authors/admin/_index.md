I am a first year graduate student at the IMPRS for Brain and Behaviour, working with Prof. Kevin Briggman. My project involves elucidating the devleopment of neural circuits for locomotion during metamorphosis, in the tadpole _Xenopus tropicalis_.

My interests lie in understanding the neural bases of behaviour, and building tools to make studying behaviour a bit easier.
